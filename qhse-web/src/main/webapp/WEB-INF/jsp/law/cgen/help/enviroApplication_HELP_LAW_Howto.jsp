                        <br>
                        &quot;Primary&quot; legislation is generally National

                        All the the relevant legislation is covered, however by

                        <br>
                        The legislation is organised into Categories for convenience 
                        - AIR, WATER, WASTE, EQUIPMENT, PROTECTION OF WORKERS,

                        Each synopsis has one or more Checklist Items - these 
                        are the elements of the piece of legislation that may 
                        require control. <br>
                        Each Checklist has a &quot;Relevancy&quot; entered against
